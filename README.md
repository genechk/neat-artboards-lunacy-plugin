# Neat Artboards (Lunacy / Sketch plugin)

It’s a simple plugin that arranges Artboards into grid layout with specified number of columns.

This plugin is specifically developed to be used with [Lunacy App](https://icons8.com/lunacy) which doesn’t support CocoaScript. Therefore it comes with certain limitations compared to other similar plugins, notably with regards to UI.

_(Currently in early development stage)_
